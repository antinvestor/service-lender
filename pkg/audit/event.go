// Package audit provides an append-only, per-service audit log for
// tracing every important state change in the fintech platform.
//
// The core idea is that anything that moves money, transitions a workflow
// state machine, or mutates a credit/limit boundary gets written to
// audit_events with enough context to reconstruct exactly what happened
// without having to replay the event bus or inspect git history:
//
//   - who did it (actor id, actor type)
//   - what entity it was done against (type, id, scope)
//   - what action was performed (domain verb: "disbursement.issued",
//     "repayment.applied", "savings.deposit.settled", etc.)
//   - what the state looked like before and after (optional JSON blobs)
//   - why it was done (human-readable reason)
//   - when it happened (CreatedAt)
//   - any metadata the caller thinks is useful later
//
// Rows are strictly append-only: there is no Update path and any caller
// that tries to mutate a row goes through Create with a new id. The
// event handler silently succeeds on duplicate-key so replays converge.
//
// Each service migrates its own audit_events table so the log is scoped
// to the service that wrote it; this keeps cross-service reads explicit
// rather than accidental, and it matches how the rest of the fintech
// platform partitions its storage.
