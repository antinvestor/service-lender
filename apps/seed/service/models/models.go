// Package models defines the seed product data model. Seed is the
// direct-to-client lending product: a client with verified KYC and
// identity can request a loan at any time, receives it up to a limit
// derived from their credit profile, and unlocks higher limits by
// successfully repaying.
//
// The data model captures three things:
//
//  1. CreditProfile   — per-client credit state (tier, limit, counters).
//     One row per (client, currency) pair.
//
//  2. CreditTierConfig — the platform-wide ladder of tiers: each tier has
//     a minimum number of successful repayments required to enter it and
//     a maximum loan amount a client in that tier can borrow. This is
//     stored (not hard-coded) so credit policy can be tuned without a
//     code release.
//
//  3. LoanRequest     — a customer-initiated loan request. This is the
//     seed product's own record of "the customer asked for X"; the
//     downstream loan request and loan account in the loans service
//     are linked back to it via loan_request_id and loan_account_id.
