// SavingsBalance is the authoritative running-balance snapshot for a savings
// account. It holds:
//
//   - Balance          total settled funds available to the account
//   - ReservedBalance  funds earmarked by pending withdrawals
//
// Available funds for a new withdrawal are (Balance - ReservedBalance). All
// mutations must go through atomic SQL on the repository (Credit/Reserve/
// DebitReserved/ReleaseReserved) so concurrent deposit/withdrawal flows
// serialize correctly at the row level without application-side locking.
//
// Balance itself is updated only when a transfer order reaches the external
// Ledger successfully, so drift between this snapshot and the Ledger should
// only ever arise from a bug or an in-flight operation, never from races.
